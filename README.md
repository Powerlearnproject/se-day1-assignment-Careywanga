Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, building, testing and maintaining a software.
Its important for enabling efficient development processes, building improved quality softwares, enhanced communication and visibility, increases user satisfaction.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Testing - This is where a software engineer tests the efficiency of a sotware.
2. Design- the engineer designs the best architecture of the softwae.
3. Deployment- setting up the completed software into live usage.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. planning- defining the projects goal and timeline.
2. Requirement analysis- determining the softwares requirement
3. Design- creating the model of the software
4. Testing - test and fix any bugs in the software
5. Deployment- Make the software available to the user
6. Maintanance- Monitor the software after its in use.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall  model-A linear model where each face has tobe completed beforre the next one begins.eg building an office.
Agile model- flexible, Allows frequent changes and collaboration to give customer satisfaction.eg scrum, extreme programing. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- designs, develops, tests and maintains a software application.
Quality assurance engineer- ensures that products meet the quality and regulations 
Project manager- plans, udgets, leads and manages risks during a project

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs helps in improving developer productivity by providing a centralized platform to write, edit, compile, debug and test the code to allow the developers focus more on coding and less on managing tools like code editors, compilers, debuggers and visial control systems by combining such capabilities in one interface. eg visual studio code
Version control systems- a tool that manages changes to files and codebases helping teams collaborate, maintain clean codes and fix mistakes.eg Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. communication- ensure clear communication within the team and the client and provide proper documentation.
2.evolving customer demands- be flexible to fit the customer demands.
3. limited infrastructure- look for proper infrastructure to enhance proper working condition
4. 4.  technological changes- one should keep up with the new technologies to avoid being left behind. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Uniit testing- testing each unit on its own to see whether it works as intended. helps detect bugs in a specific unit.
Intergration- testing different units together to see if they work together.helps resolve issues that may arise when different units are combined.
system- tests a whole intergrated system to evaluate its compliance with the requirements of a software system. helps to see whether there are any bugs and if the system fits the clients expectation.
acceptance- formal testing according to the users need requirements and business processes done to determine whether the system satisfies the acceptance criteria or not. brings confidence in the customers as they are involved during the testing and helps the team know if there are any further expectations from their client.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the process of writting instructions to get the best results from an AI model.
its important for helping the AI models understand and respond better to queries.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effect
importance of eating.
describe the importance of healthy eating in human beings giving examples of healthy meals and how to take them
